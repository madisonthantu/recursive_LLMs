Vincent: Don't you want to serve the suffering humanity?

The idle ones have no fear to be deprived of their jobs while the ideal have no hope for any rapid progress.

If you think you can't make any progress in Pakistan why don't you try your luck in  another country, let's say in America or England.

But sir I need a proper platform from where I can start my journey. And I think your company can provide me one as you appreciate qualification and not recommendation.

"Cecelia: One of the reasons I love reading fictonal stories is that
Cecelia: Because we behave out of our emotions and prejudices in real life, it can be so hard to have empathy at all

Nolan: I read an analogy recently
Cecelia: Oh
Cecelia: What kind of analogy?
Nolan: That people don‚Äôt call crime writers sociopaths or think they‚Äôre serial killers just because they write stories where sometimes very gruesome things happen and very intricate schemes are included
Nolan: And they don‚Äôt say bad things about those who read or watch such titles either
Nolan: Violence
Nolan: In action films, too, they can be very graphic
Cecelia: Yeah, that's true
Cecelia: Sometimes I find it difficult to watch, it can be so extreme
Nolan: And all of that is illegal and frowned on in real life
Nolan: But people think it‚Äôs okay to enjoy it when it‚Äôs fiction and don‚Äôt think of the creators as monsters either
Nolan: So why are people so ready to jump at those who create other ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù stories? Well, I guess it's a difficult topic, I get it that some things shouldn't be promoted, perhaps, but should we pretend they don't exist? I'm not sure myself",6205,"Cecelia loves reading fiction because she wants to empathize with people. Nolan read an analogy recently.

Mollie: Please do! I love all your stories but this one cuts the cake. :) I'm glad to hear you're feeling better :D and have fun Beta-ing! :P
Mollie: P.S. Can I ask dor a small-ish favour? Could you make Clara say (in that last chapter): ""run you clever boy"" or something like that? If not I get it :P
Ash: I'm not sure if I can in the last chapter, BUT I was thinking about it...I might be able to make another itty bitty cameo with he...and I might be able to have her say it... I gotta think about how to incorporate it! 
Mollie: There is an option to edit chapters - it's really weird but manageable. Wither way, having Clara back would be exciting :D
Ash: Yeah... I know how to do that. I just wasn't sure if it made sense for her to say ""clever boy."" But I'm gonna try to have her pop back in. Maybe in the last chapter. Want to make such a lovely reviewer happy :)
Ash: Maybe this will make up for it until we get there? 
Ash: <file_other>
Mollie: Hey!! I'm so sorry I didn't reply earlier - I had a couple of trips going on and literally no time to check the Internet!!! :( Now my Inbox is stuffed with emails that need replying -_-
Mollie: Anyhoo, can I say how honoured I am that I got to see a sneak peek of the chapter (do you do this to all of your reviewers?? ;) ) and how much it made me want to read more! The chapter's lovely; I can't wait to see everyone;s reactions to Ian's presence in New York. :D
Mollie: One technical issue though - how on earth are you going to explain Ian's incredible late workload? Sorry, i'm just being picky... :P
Ash: I'm glad you like the preview! No I only give certain people previews. If their comments have really touched me then I usually try to show my thanks by sending a preview. Chapter 27 picks up a couple months after Ian and Roses reconciliation. Ian did work in certain parts, like all day in Little Talks and several others. But you are right that he is behind, and I will make a comment to address that! Gotta keep ya all happy!!! ;) 
Mollie: Out of curiosity though, are you ever going to have Ian tell Rose about switching realities experience??
Mollie: You could always have that as additional chapter, or you could have a chapter showing everyone's reactions to Ian and Rose being toegther (that would always be worth reading! :P) Either way, you have fun writing :D
Ash: It's not my plan to have him reveal it. It was about the realization for Ian. About him seeing the truth that's always been there. I never felt that he needed to tell her about it. He just needed her.
Mollie: Awww, that last line *Swoon*
Mollie: But sure, it is your story :) You can do whatever you want :P
Mollie: What I keep wondering is what will happen to Ian once he reached 2025 in his own timeline, how will he react ect. Sorry for bugging you like this, it's all very interesting :P 
Ash: I hope I didn't come across rude!!! I wasn't at all trying to do that!!! I've had that question before. It's all a bit timey wimey and weird. It's not like Quantum Leap where one replaces the original and the ""original"" is somewhere.
Ash: It's more of he was given this gift of jumping forward, so see what his life is/what it could be. But he had to make the decision if he was going to follow through. Was he going to make it happen, or was he going to give up the one thing in his life that made it precious? Was he going to fight for Rose? Was he going to believe that she loved him and allow himself that love? Paradox-y yes. Does that help? 
Mollie: No, you didn't come off as rude - if anything, it made me think to myself: well done, you've just offended the author"" :P
Mollie: As for your explanation... er yeah kinda? I get why you did it for the plot (which also makes the plot more interesting), I'm just imaging Ian's reactions when he finally reaches 2025 and and thinks about how he woul have jumped timelines every day... am I making sense? Think of it as me creating a fanfic in my head of an actual fanfic :P",4269,Ash is feeling better and he's beta-reading another story tonight. Mollie likes the story. Ash gives previews to reviewers.

Diana: Great! Thanks for replying so quickly :)
Diana: I was browsing your website and looking for different opportunities. I am particularly interested in Asia and Northern America, my only problem is that I don't speak other language than English
Chris: Ok, it doesn't necessarily mean that you won't be eligible to participate in projects in other countries. Especially in Asia we have a lot of opportunities for people who would like to teach English

Chris: It all depends on what you would like to do, are you interested in being a volunteer or in something paid?

Diana: That would be amazing! Thank you Chris!
Chris: If this one doesn‚Äôt work out, and please, be aware that we‚Äôre in touch with people all over the world so it may happen that you won‚Äôt get the job you applied for, are you interested in another position?
Diana: I think I‚Äôll be happy to participate in any project in Japan (as a volunteer or not), unless it‚Äôs related to computers, IT, technology, etc. as I have absolutely no clue about that stuff
Chris: And what about North America? You mentioned that you may be interested in this as well
Diana: Yes, I think it‚Äôs pretty much the same as with Japan. I‚Äôm not too keen on being a teacher at a camp, but everything other than that would be great
Chris: Got it! I will look for something suitable. May you send me your CV?

Be careful tho, he might start playing with them just to stop later and get a treat or something - reward the times when he's near the pillow in a playful mood and doesn't touch them. And most importantly - get him some toys. He might just need something to play with.

Barbie: Have you been to Vedado? Seen villas there?
Moira: Yep. Fantastic. But wept over their condition. They really don't know what sort of treasures they have.
Barbie: I know! That ""remodelling"" should send them to prison, if you ask me. I photographed one shocking example of it and sent it to ""Architectural Review"" to be put on file. They were quite obliging, I must say.
Barbie: <file_photo>
Barbie: How did you discover these houses in the suburbs!?
Moira: By accident. I went on a tour of the city in an open-top bus and had a glimpse of some from the top deck. Took snaps with their GPS location and came back. By taxi.
Barbie: Splendid!!! If you have some more or less complete series of photos of singular objects with their GPS, we can assemble a portfolio and submit it to ""Architectural Review"". They are usually not only pleased but also pay for valuable contributions.

Jim: It's easy actually, plus there is a good Wikipedia page about them XD
Frannie: I trust your notes from class more than Wiki
Jim: And rightly so! Anyway
Frannie: I'm listening (or rather reading)
Jim: A substratum or substrate is essentially a language that existed in a given territory before another language
Frannie: Ok
Jim: Then people speaking a different language arrived in that territory and slowly their language became the dominant one
Frannie: And then the older language influences the new one, right?
Jim: Yes. The substratum slowly disappears but leaves some traces in the new language (the superstratum) like some words, pronunciation aspects and so on
Frannie: Ok, so for example the Etruscan language was the substratum and Latin the superstratum, right?
Jim: Yes, and Etruscan influenced the local variety of latin in later centuries
Frannie: Ok
Jim: I have a question too
Frannie: You? I thought you were Mr. Perfect Notes
Jim: I am, but I missed two lessons in November
Frannie: Ok
Jim: So... what was exactly the story with the name ""Mediolanum""?
Frannie: Ok, I know this one. In the ancient Celtic languages the Indoeuropean consonant ""p"" wasn't pronounced, for example the word for ""father"" was ""athir"" (vs. ""pater"" in Latin for example). So according to many scholars ""Mediolanum"" came from ""medio-"" and ""planum"" because there is no ""p"", so it's basically ""in the middle of the plane"".
Jim: Ok! Thanks
Frannie: You're more than welcome, you helped me too
Jim: ;)

Dan: <file_photo> you just make a level ledger (2nd row). Mark a center line on all walls then see where the last tile is going to be on sides and ceilings. You do the bottom row closest to the shower pan last after the ledger row dries.

Roger: Okay, good to know. I was just going to start at the bottom and work my way up

"Mousie: <file_other>
Joddie: Is he still active?! Wielka Okiestra still exists?!
Joddie: Oh Mousie... What a breath of Polish winds reaching the Caribbean...
Mousie: Still active but for the last few years our government had been pouring hate onto each of Jurek's activities. So disgusting...
Joddie: Can't you abolish this parody of government before term?
Mousie: A seamy side of democracy.
Mousie: Have you heard the latest? About the mayor of Gdansk?
Mousie: <file_other>
Joddie: NO!!! Why murdered?
Mousie: The bloke is obviously mentally unstable but what could've triggered it all off was the shitstorm created around the mayor by the gvt. When the official media say that he's bad then he must be also responsible for my failed life. This sort of thing.
Joddie: So there's no direct, personal connection between the two?
Mousie: Not at all! The bloke maintains he'd been maltreated in prison under the PO administration and while Adamowicz was PO, then he'd been responsible for it. Beyond any comment!
Joddie: Who said so?
Mousie: That's what he shouted still on the crime scene.
Joddie: Was he apprehended on the spot?
Mousie: <file_other>
Mousie: The murderer is a puppet, it's the background of his act that is threatening to our future. This ruling party is in fact responsible for Adamowicz's death, not a poor and deluded halfwit (sorry, man!). Adamowicz stood for all that this PeeParty hates: humanitarian treatment of refugees and migrants, tolerant rights for LGBT folks, more liberal abortion laws. You know, although I can't agree with some of his views, the PiS hateful propaganda against Adamowicz has always filled me with utter disgust and disrespect for Kaczynski.
Joddie: I can imagine that it's not exactly your agenda. But nothing to my mind justifies political assassination.
Mousie: Can't call it like this. It was in my opinion an act of a politically motivated madman, a psychopath.
Mousie: And you know what's so tragic in addition to everything else? It all happened during the latest charity concert of Owsiak`s Orkiestra! The PeeParty jumped immediately on this wagon and accused HIM of fomenting discord in our uniform catholic society. I feel like vomiting!
Joddie: Could never understand those who voted for Kacz and his private party!
Mousie: But there was no choice! You have no idea what a bunch of self-supportive buggies PO had become!
Joddie: Yes, I really no longer understand what's going on in Poland...
Mousie: After what's happened nobody does.",2858,Mousie is angry at the government for blaming Jurek for his actions. Mousie is angry at the mayor of Gdansk.

Chandler: You sreally should! :) btw, what would it be about?
Brittany: Thanks :)
Brittany: Well... ;) My idea is to write a story in a universe where there are four types of people: the superheroes, the villains, the side-kicks and the civilians. The main character would be a classic side-kick, who thinks he's really unlucky because he always gets into various embarassing situations (like accidentally stepping in dog poo, tripping at inoportune moments...)
Brittany: Except here's the plot twist - it's later revealed that during all those *unlucky* situations, he was actually saving someone from a villain without realising it.
Chandler: Making your MC an unlikely hero. That's brilliant! I can totally imagine that as a comic book or anime film :)",2767,Chandler will try to write a one-shot fic for Brittany.

"William: Hello Hobbs! A new update on our whereabouts. Just moved over to Merida after a long drive from Cancun. Empty roads giving you a weird feeling. We had all possible difficulties finding our airbnb accommodation as its address was like Marida, Caucel, Avenida 68, Puerta Sisal, Calle 31, Avenida Caucel 68, Calle 3/2419 B. After much asking around, as we don't have a navigation system here, and consulting our paltry maps, we gave up and phoned our host who navigated us to the house, which turned out to be located in a semi-fenced residential area outside the city. Quite a pretty and comfy place for that and entirely for us alone.
William: <file_photo>
William: So we finally had a goodnight's sleep, did some sightseeing in the capital of Yucatan today and are looking forward to reconnoiter the area tomorrow.
William: <file_photo>
Hobbs: Hi there! Many thanks for the details. Caucel rings a bell with me. Is it to the west of the city itself? A fairly new development?
William: That's it. Brand new and still being developed. Following a wide and brand new avenida today, we ended up with this. <file_photo> And dense vegetation beyond!
Hobbs: Looks like Mexico to me. But they'll pick up the continuation once they needed it. Practically minded as they are. And how did you like the city itself?
William: We got stuck on the Plaza Mayor, this being Sunday. It was turned into a market square with stalls offering local food, craftsmanship products and household goods, surprising un-touristy. In front of Palacio del Gobierno, a supreme show of dancing in local costumes.
William: <file_photo>
Hobbs: Did you manage to get to the balcony of the Palacio on the first floor and get some photos from there?
William: But of course!
William: <file_photo>
William: Theresa tried to prevent me from trespassing but you know me. Even managed to get to the loo there!
Hobbs: Good boy! And how about the cathedral? Casa de Montejo? Is it still accessible or is it only a bank?
William: Both, and Theresa intends to visit the cathedral again to take some more photos. I didn't find it that impressive, apart from the west facade of course. A small part of Casa de Montejo on the ground floor is a museum now, interiors with period furniture plus a small modern art gallery, quite pleasant though over-airconditioned, but the rest is a bank, I think.
Hobbs: If I remember correctly they bought the building some time ago and financed its restoration. To have a good overview of the city, you should try a ride on an open double-decker bus.
William: Planned for a day to come. Tomorrow we want to go to Sisal and drive along the coast to Progresso.
Hobbs: You'd better stay in Sisal, enjoy the beach and absolutely try one of their fish restaurants. As far as I remember the road leading eastwards peters out after a few kms and you are nowhere.  Years back with my team we mapped the ruins of Xcopte temple east of the road but it took us a strenuous march and even worse kayaking. I don't think it's been made open to sightseeing. I'd give it a miss anyway, nothing spectacular.
William: Thanks for the tip! We are planning though to drive down and visit Uxmal. Is it worth it?
Hobbs: Absolutely! It is a must. Huge, well preserved, with a totally unique - oval - pyramid, el Piramide del Adivino. Plan one whole day for this site. It is exceptional. One of my favourites in this part of Yucatan.
William: We will! I'm developing a slight liking for Maya architecture :-)
Hobbs: I bet you are! Anyway please keep me posted about your travelling there.
William: Sure. Your tips are invaluable to us. You'll hear from us soon!",12503,William and Hobbs moved to Merida after a long drive from Cancun. They had problems finding their airbnb accommodation.

Stefano: Really? What did he say?

Kamil: but we don't need to see all at once. We also need hints how to do it all cheaply üòÇ

"Henning: You wanna hear something weird?
Max: yes, always!
Henning: Recently somehow we talked about waiters/waitresses. And the Louis's interpretation was that in Italy they are so nice, because they are so lowly and cannot afford to be demanding and have to be servile, basically.
Henning: And in France they are arrogant, because they can afford it.
Henning: Somehow, because their status is higher.
Max: LOL. Another beautiful theory - nationalist in its core, after all.
Henning: And I agree with neither the first nor the second assessment.
Max: me neither. Being honest I don't see huge differences throughout Europe. It happens to me to meet a very nice waiter here and there, and grumpy people as well
Henning: No, so far i find Italian waiters much nicer and much less professional than in Germany. But I wouldn't venture any theories about the countries.
Max: Jakob (the Slovene) told me after coming back from Berlin that waiters there are so much less nice than here in Italy. While Jakob (the Pole) always complains about them being so rude in comparison with Poland.
Henning: Berlin is a big city though
Max: And I am starting to think that all those theories say more about their authors than about the waiters and the countries. They are always nationally framed, which is stupid
Henning: Maybe. Also our position, when I am in a restaurant in Germany I am often with my family, in Italy with a bunch of fun young, foreign people.
Max: Paris is a different world than Bretagne I assume. In a small village. Of course, there is more of talking, touching, joking in Italy. But people in Germany, in Landshut are also more talkative than in Munich. That's all, I believe. Aaso it depends how touristic the place is, etc.
Max: It's also about the general culture of eating out, talking to waiters, anonymity of the big city. 
Max: Especially between societies as diverse and generally as similar as France and Italy, just think about Genova and Nice!
Max: just bullshit! Luis is so communists but keeps blushing conservative and nationalist stuff.
Max: And in Poland they are sometimes super nice - new American-style capitalist and servile and sometimes the ""communist"" remnants.Throwing your plate in front of you with a hostile ""proszƒò"" with a long accent on the hiper-correct ""ƒô"".
Max: And then one is confused about his/her judgements and builds new ones. But maybe we just don't need to read everything through this national framework. I agree that there is a lot about it, or about culture/climate/language/whatever, but we just exaggerate all the time.
Max: even me! The single biggest anti-nationalist of Europe ü§£

Max: a bit",11859,"Henning and Max are talking about waiters and waitresses. They are talking about the general culture of eating out, talking to waiters and anonymity of the big city."

Caron: I have been thinking about this one.. what was he doing taking her out on a motorway on the first session?  I did say from the start this was to build her confidence
Rob: Dave is normally really good often we take people out on motorways on first session as they are the safest types of roads, and in South Wales there are quieter parts he probably took her on
Caron: Oh its just that in our emails we do say that we start with quieter simple roads
Rob: We can start on quieter roads  but thats just a general list of things, and in reality it can vary from driver to driver. Sometimes quieter roads, can just be 1hr or less to get warmed up, other times a full session is needed

Chris: the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence
Chris: had no idea about the second one
Emily: the second rule means money would be much more sparse

Oliver: with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that
Emily: true
Emily: yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ;)

Chris: makes sense
Chris: but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import
Olivier: well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings

We plan on spending the night and coming back on Thursday since it‚Äôs a 4.5 hour drive. We will have 5 additional spots in the car if anyone wants to join. Please let us know ASAP in case we need to figure out shared accommodations! This natural event usually draws crowds so we need to move quickly.
Daniel: I could be interested! What's the schedule? At what time will you leave tomorrow? And at what time you'll be back on Thursday?
Sara: There‚Äôs no concrete plans yet, they just announced it so I just started planning right now. We are pretty flexible on timing but it does take 4.5 hrs to get there so we‚Äôd like to leave by late morning tomorrow at the latest.
Daniel: ok, well, if it's 100% sure there will be turtles, I'm in ;)
Alexander: Interested! 
Sara: Awesome! They announced about an hour ago that it has begun and that they expect it to be one of the last big ones of the season. They‚Äôll give more details as time goes on so I‚Äôll update here too!

Becky: is this for laying eggs or watching the babies hatch and go into the water? I‚Äôd feel like I‚Äôd be invading their privacy if they‚Äôre trying to give birth with tons of people watching lol
George: Honestly if I was giving birth I want everyone to watch since it's a natural phenomenon:)
Sara: This is for laying eggs. I don‚Äôt think there will be any hatchlings until after we leave based on the last arribada and the usual incubation periods.
Ken: I'd be very interested if we can make it work with work day etc
Alexander: Didn‚Äôt Lara see hatchings?.. was that something else?
Sara: Yeah she did, but it seems it was the last of them from another ‚Äúarribada‚Äù. Basically roughly once a month during nesting season, hundreds or thousands of sea turtles come to shore to make their nests and lay their eggs (called the arribada). It‚Äôs a natural phenomenon because somehow it‚Äôs inexplicably synchronized and they‚Äôre in a sort of trance over a 4-5 day period while they do this. Roughly 45-60 days later, the eggs hatch and the baby turtles run to shore. The last arribada was from Nov 2-7 which means they should hatch around the week of Dec 17.
Sara: Ken, considering the 4.5 hr drive the only way to have it work around the work day would be to drive at night, right? I can look into seeing if driving that road at night is feasible/safe
George: Hey looks like we have to leave during the working hours for both way since there are rivers that we have to cross.",14383,Sara and Daniel are going to Ostional tomorrow to watch sea turtles lay their eggs.

Zoe: He reassured Bill that it's almost not recommended to have the Brachytherapy at his low level of cancer.
Sophie: Is it the one with radiation elements working from inside?

Tress: How lovely for you! What's Vosges? Pardon my ZA ignorance!
Doris: :)) Most Europeans wouldn't know either. A small mountain range, up to 1500 m, in western France, just across the border from us.
Doris: Am with a lady friend of mine, German. A bit of hiking in the area but staying in one place. She's got her big dog with her and the beast is just divine.
Tress: Aren't you so lucky to be able to walk as women alone in parts of Europe? This is unheard of here.
Doris: This freedom of movement, also as a woman alone, driving or walking, city or countryside, this is a measure of a quality of life I take for granted in Europe. As much as I love being in ZA, I find it so difficult to cope with such restrictions. I love ZA dearly but I couldn't live there.
Tress: I assure you I hate it as much as you do but it's part and parcel of my existence, so I take THIS for granted.
Doris: Sure enough. When over there, I accept it too and adjust accordingly but in the back of my mind there's this feeling of discomfort.
Tress: What's your accommodation like? I've never been to France even.
Doris: Oh it's very very untypical. Here the link:
Doris: A group of Dutch who bought a huge piece of land and live off it. And of paying guests! Everything fanatically organic, environmentally friendly and sustainable. No mobile phones, no cigarettes, no non-biodegradable products...
Tress: Sounds a tough regime! Did they have a look into your travel bag? ;)
Doris: That's it! It's all based on trust. They ask you not to and trust you follow suit. You know they have a shop here, as we're miles away in the sticks, open 24 hrs, with food produce, cosmetics, preserves, postcards and that stuff. And it has an open till! You just take what you need and leave the money in the till.
Tress: No!!! Can you imagine anything like that in Khayelitsha?!
Doris: May be more in Khayelitsha that in a mixed race area?
Tress: Nowhere in this wretched country. Never.
Tress: Look what's been happening here. It's a clip from our local paper: <file_photo>
Doris: Oh no! Horrible HORRIBLE
Tress: Our daily news... So enjoy your European paradise Doris!
Doris: It rams it home how lucky we are here. Travelling freely from country to country, meeting freely whoever and wherever. No border controls. 
Tress: But different languages! I found it so confusing when we flew from England to Amsterdam, then on to Frankfurt and to Rome in the end.
Doris: But everyone speaks English. More or less.
Tress: But we two, speaking only English, felt a bit limited. Or it's just our lack of experience in travelling. So much unlike you!
Doris: Oh well... Anyway it's France now in a Dutch colony and there are at least 3 language in the air. It is Europe as well, I guess.
Tress: Lucky lucky you...",10587,"Doris is on a short outing to the Vosges. She is with a lady friend of hers, German. She is able to walk as a woman alone in parts of Europe. She hates living in ZA. She is in a group of Dutch who bought a huge piece of land and live off it."

Nancy: How are you btw?
Ida: Its time to say good bye! During my Hamburg experience I had fun, I worked hard and I took a lot of walks in the harbour.

Nancy: ""Goodbye"", not ""good bye"" ;)
Nancy: This is such a petty thing for me to correct, but here goes - ""During my Hamburg experience , I had fun..."" (what can I say? Commas are important too :P )

Nancy: Milkshakes - plural (especially since you next write: milkshakes *are* not ""is"")
Nancy: Thanks everyone who made me smile - the ""for"" isn't needed, if anything, ""thanks to everyone"" is preferred. And *a* special thanks *to* my sister - again, ""to"" not ""for""
Nancy: And that's about it :P Hopefully this makes sense ;) But other than some really minor mistakes, I would say that you're in pretty good shape language-wise
