"Mousie: <file_other>
Joddie: Is he still active?! Wielka Okiestra still exists?!
Joddie: Oh Mousie... What a breath of Polish winds reaching the Caribbean...
Mousie: Still active but for the last few years our government had been pouring hate onto each of Jurek's activities. So disgusting...
Joddie: Can't you abolish this parody of government before term?
Mousie: A seamy side of democracy.
Mousie: Have you heard the latest? About the mayor of Gdansk?
Mousie: <file_other>
Joddie: NO!!! Why murdered?
Mousie: The bloke is obviously mentally unstable but what could've triggered it all off was the shitstorm created around the mayor by the gvt. When the official media say that he's bad then he must be also responsible for my failed life. This sort of thing.
Joddie: So there's no direct, personal connection between the two?
Mousie: Not at all! The bloke maintains he'd been maltreated in prison under the PO administration and while Adamowicz was PO, then he'd been responsible for it. Beyond any comment!
Joddie: Who said so?
Mousie: That's what he shouted still on the crime scene.
Joddie: Was he apprehended on the spot?
Mousie: <file_other>
Mousie: The murderer is a puppet, it's the background of his act that is threatening to our future. This ruling party is in fact responsible for Adamowicz's death, not a poor and deluded halfwit (sorry, man!). Adamowicz stood for all that this PeeParty hates: humanitarian treatment of refugees and migrants, tolerant rights for LGBT folks, more liberal abortion laws. You know, although I can't agree with some of his views, the PiS hateful propaganda against Adamowicz has always filled me with utter disgust and disrespect for Kaczynski.
Joddie: I can imagine that it's not exactly your agenda. But nothing to my mind justifies political assassination.
Mousie: Can't call it like this. It was in my opinion an act of a politically motivated madman, a psychopath.
Mousie: And you know what's so tragic in addition to everything else? It all happened during the latest charity concert of Owsiak`s Orkiestra! The PeeParty jumped immediately on this wagon and accused HIM of fomenting discord in our uniform catholic society. I feel like vomiting!
Joddie: Could never understand those who voted for Kacz and his private party!
Mousie: But there was no choice! You have no idea what a bunch of self-supportive buggies PO had become!
Joddie: Yes, I really no longer understand what's going on in Poland...
Mousie: After what's happened nobody does.",2858,Mousie is angry at the government for blaming Jurek for his actions. Joddie is not happy with the way the government has been portrayed in Poland.

Nancy: Hey! Of course - no problem :D Just send me what you wrote and I'll look through it ;)
Nancy: How are you btw?
Ida: Its time to say good bye! During my Hamburg experience I had fun, I worked hard and I took a lot of walks in the harbour. I also realised that #Fischbrotchen and milkshake are not a perfect match. But most of all - I met incredible, inspiring and freindly people who gave me the best memories. Thanks for everyone, who made me smile! + special thanks for my sister who survived 5 months with me and my Netflix obsession.
Ida: Thanks a lot: Here it is (some cheesy jokes included, but I didnt want to sound too pompous XD )
Ida: I'm fine, tomorrow I'm leaving Germany ;) But i miss France actually :D What about you? Still studying in Bordeaux? ;)
Nancy: Hey, I couldn't answer you straight away - here are my corrections:
Nancy: It's time to say... It's = it is; Its = possessive form of it, meaning ""of it"". 2 examples  - 'The building was missing its windows.' and 'it's a lovely day outside!'
Nancy: ""Goodbye"", not ""good bye"" ;)
Nancy: This is such a petty thing for me to correct, but here goes - ""During my Hamburg experience , I had fun..."" (what can I say? Commas are important too :P )
Nancy: I took a lot of walks *on* the harbour - just like you would say: ""I took a walk on the beach"" not ""in the beach""
Nancy: Milkshakes - plural (especially since you next write: milkshakes *are* not ""is"")
Nancy: Thanks everyone who made me smile - the ""for"" isn't needed, if anything, ""thanks to everyone"" is preferred. And *a* special thanks *to* my sister - again, ""to"" not ""for""
Nancy: And that's about it :P Hopefully this makes sense ;) But other than some really minor mistakes, I would say that you're in pretty good shape language-wise 
Ida: I had a great teacher ;) 
Ida: Thank you very much! <3 Even in French I double-check what I write if it goes public XD

"Dennis: Happy New Year! How's life? Any more travelling? Do you still see a lot of your travelling companion (I don’t think you ever mentioned his name). Or are you taking it easy in your rural idyll.
Laura: Hello my dear Dennis! Happy New Year to you too! Am in Cuba at the moment. What a country!
Dennis: Never been there myself but it's on my itinerary. What's it like?
Laura: A bit tough, truth to tell, but you'd like it. Abject living conditions for local people but we're in a ""touristy"" cocoon, so one easily overlooks the other side. Splendid landscapes, incredible architecture but in a more than sorry state of preservation. I love and hate to be here at the same time.
Dennis: So you aren't travelling alone, I presume.
Laura: No, my travelling companion takes me along, so to speak, to his winter quarters, since his health doesn't cope that well with European winters. I couldn't afford these travels entirely on my own of course.
Dennis: Always thought Cuba is not expensive. Especially the post-Fidel Cuba.
Laura: Just the contrary. In the good old days when it was supported by the Soviet Union, the living standard was not bad and they didn't have to rely on income from tourism. Then it all went down the drain, even famine and food rationing have become their daily thing. Since early 00s most not rationed goods are available only for CUC, their convertible currency. The bottom line being that whatever you buy as a tourist, you pay +/- western prices.
Dennis: So how much do you two spend daily?
Laura: Staying in private houses about at least 100€, including food, transport and entrance fees. These days we are compelled to stay at a state-run Hotel and pay thru the nose - 130€ a night. No, Cuba is not cheap. But Havana Club YES.
Dennis: Don't like the stuff at all.
Laura: Me neither. Gives me headaches. Even one glass of it.
Dennis: What you say will make me think twice before setting sail for Cuba.
Laura: But it can be fantastic as well. Eg Vinales Valley in the west, with its horse-riding trips, wild camping and pure nature.
Dennis: Sounds better. I'll ask you for details.
Dennis: Anyway enjoy your trip as much as you can. Happy trails toyou two!

"John: Hello everyone! I’m thinking about buying a cross trainer. Does anyone of you have any experience in using it at home? Could you maybe recommend me something?
Anna: Hi John! I bought my first cross trainer a couple of years ago and I have been using one ever since. The type of the machine greatly depends on your built and how much many you would like to spend.
John: My budget is quite limited as is the space in my living room…
Michael: I’d advise you to first measure the room to know how big the machine can actually be for you to exercise comfortably and effectively.
Tom: Waste of money, most expensive cloth hanger
John: Hahaha, I hope it won’t be in my case. I’m quite determined to lose some weight. I’m tall and a bit overweight, so I worry that I may break the machine
Anna: Don’t worry about that. It shouldn’t be a problem, but have a look at the specs just in case.
Michael: When it comes to the price, cheaper models don’t have as many electronic options as the more expensive do, but I’d advise you to invest in it if you’re being serious about losing weight.
John: Why’s that?
Michael: You can always exercise with your phone and an app, but it’s not the most comfortable way (tried it myself). It’s good to have at least three preinstalled programmes like weight-loss, interval, etc. Then the machine will think for you.
Anna: My first cross trainer didn’t have such options and I must admit that I was also training with my phone and keeping my times. Now, when the old broke, I bought a “fancier” model and I definitely don’t regret it
John: Do you have any company you can recommend? Or a specific model?
Susan: I have OBE8731 Powerstride 18"" Rear Drive and I think it’s ok.
Anna: I think that in case of cross trainer it really goes down to the price range. You won’t be able to buy a really good equipment cheaply.
Michael: I agree, especially if you’re determined and interested in your scores. It may sound silly, but I think tracking your progress helps to lose weight.
John: Thank you so much for your advice! I can’t spend too much, but I don’t want to throw my money away on something that won’t serve me…
Anna: Sure, again, in my opinion it is a thing worth investing in. Look up some tutorials and exercise plans in Google, it will also help you out to achieve your goal.
Michael: Good luck!",6762,John is thinking about buying a cross trainer. Anna recommends him to buy a bigger model.

Jessie: Hahaha, I get that :D
Barbara: But to be fair it's a nice city, maybe just not for me. I think if I'd known French, it could have been different.
Jessie: I can relate. It's been exactly the same in Paris. Loved the city, but the whole experience was a bit weird with the waiters outraged that we didn't speak French.
Barbara: Kind of the same in Quebec then ;) Although they do have beautiful architecture and city landscape. If you have chance, go there, I'd give them another chance.

Kelly: Yes, but we love this dream of life that is love and love that is life
Ann: And this creates dependency, jealousy, frustrations, drama

Ann: Or now, under the new regime of supposed sexual freedom, with the opposite plan: nothings lasts and love doesn't matter. But this is substituting an ideology with another, when we should just let it be.
Ann: Simply 😅
Kelly: Yes, I agree

Ann: Yes, the dependency that it creates is horrible

Anthony: Starting with kayaking in May, including Hetty, Ken, Joss (Hetty’s son) and Sarah on the team-sheet.
Anthony: 5 day’s kayaking, where we paddled from the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, along the Caledonian Canal in Scotland. It is mainly Loch Ness and three smaller lochs, joined up by canal sections, and is about 65 miles long.
Angela: Ant the weather? Scottish?
Anthony: It was the most perfect weather ever (we have had that sort of a summer).
Anthony: <file_photo> and the most stunning countryside.

"Max: Din anyone actually watch this the video? 
Max: <link_video>
Allen: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.
Jeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an ""occasional low cumulative"", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month.
Max: Tom You didn’t watch the video.
Tom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;)

Daniel: Short attention span 😊

Max: Jason he does - rewatch the end man. He doesn’t specifically say combing the two , but he says one usually precedes the other.

Rawiri: Jason Hollis yuck...why even???
Tom: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint?
David: I don’t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small...
Ken: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues.
Tom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine
Brian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates.
Ken: Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it.
Mark: Cannabis does not have a bad affect on the lungs!!

"Henning: You wanna hear something weird?
Max: yes, always!
Henning: Recently somehow we talked about waiters/waitresses. And the Louis's interpretation was that in Italy they are so nice, because they are so lowly and cannot afford to be demanding and have to be servile, basically.
Henning: And in France they are arrogant, because they can afford it.
Henning: Somehow, because their status is higher.
Max: LOL. Another beautiful theory - nationalist in its core, after all.
Henning: And I agree with neither the first nor the second assessment.
Max: me neither. Being honest I don't see huge differences throughout Europe. It happens to me to meet a very nice waiter here and there, and grumpy people as well
Henning: No, so far i find Italian waiters much nicer and much less professional than in Germany. But I wouldn't venture any theories about the countries.
Max: Jakob (the Slovene) told me after coming back from Berlin that waiters there are so much less nice than here in Italy. While Jakob (the Pole) always complains about them being so rude in comparison with Poland.
Henning: Berlin is a big city though
Max: And I am starting to think that all those theories say more about their authors than about the waiters and the countries. They are always nationally framed, which is stupid
Henning: Maybe. Also our position, when I am in a restaurant in Germany I am often with my family, in Italy with a bunch of fun young, foreign people.
Max: Paris is a different world than Bretagne I assume. In a small village. Of course, there is more of talking, touching, joking in Italy. But people in Germany, in Landshut are also more talkative than in Munich. That's all, I believe. Aaso it depends how touristic the place is, etc.
Max: It's also about the general culture of eating out, talking to waiters, anonymity of the big city.

"Jennifer: I will have to give a presentation on global warming on Friday, and I am so nervous.
Mary: There are a lot of things you can do to make you feel more confident and less nervous.
Jennifer: What should I do, Mary?
Mary: First of all, you need to understand the subject matter thoroughly. You need to know what is global warming, what causes global warming, and what people should do to abate the effects of global warming.
Jennifer: I have done a lot of research on the subject, and I know I can answer any questions I will receive from the audience.
Mary: The next thing that you need is an outline of your presentation. You should think about how to effectively present the subject matter.
Jennifer: You mean what I should talk about, or more precisely the sequence of my presentation?
Mary: Yes, what you should present first, second, third…
Jennifer: If that is the case, then I already have an outline. To make it easy for my audience to follow the presentation, I intend to post the outline on the board at all time during my speech.
Mary: Good idea! By the way, do you have any facts to back you up? For example, change of climate, yearly disasters…
Jennifer: No, I have not thought about that. I better get some statistics from the Internet. I should not have any problems since the Internet has all kinds of data.

Jennifer: What else do I need? Is there anything else I can do to help me relax and be at ease during my presentation?

Mary: Think positive. Tell yourself that you can do it without any problems.

But I managed to get up and didn't realise the pain until I stretched to put my nighty on. Oh bro... Horrible....

Andy: Maybe you should call in an ambulance? Are you sure you haven't broken something? A rib?

Andy: Are you coughing? Coughing blood?
Brenda: God! No! I'll see how I feel in the morning. I just need a rest. I feel so rotten, bro...
Andy: My worry would be that you've damaged something inside you. You know, split spleen, punctured lung.That sort of thing.You just watch your body.
Brenda: Yes, I will. I understand what you mean. I thought so as well. Just see how I feel tomorrow morning. Fucking hell! I can hardly pull myself up.
Andy: If I were you, I would go and see the doc first thing in the morning.

Andy: Well, he can come to your place and you'll be driven to hospital in an ambulance.
Brenda: You stop scaring the shit out of me! I am not that invalid. It's just bloody painful but I think I'm in one piece.
Andy: I don't know Brenda. One shouldn't take it too light those falls. You may still be in a state of shock and are underrating your condition. Will you phone me first thing in the morning please? Still from bed? Luise is gone by 7:30, so you won't be waking anyone up.
Brenda: OK brother. I will give you a call. Of course if I'm still alive.

Robin: ironing as well, now i was brought up wash clothes, hang them on the line let the wind air them and gravity dop creases outt, then ron them, i got chewwed out because i told the lass on nights there were shower curtains on the line, she throws a wobbler about hos its always been my job and she does more work than me and stewart, it was 5 curtains and she'd have finished all her jobs thor the shift in an hour and a half easily

Olive: Fun fact - the cleaning ladies tick was something that mistresses would do in Victorian times to make sure that the servants were doing their job properly.
Olive: One such trick involved hiding a coin, under a rug - if the servant gave the money back, she was trustworthy. If the servant took the money, the mistress would know. And if the servant missed the coin completely, she clearly wasn't doing her job.
Olive: Now that I've gotten that (interesting, but completely useless) fact out of the way, I think the only thing I can say is: hang in there. Or better yet - don't give them (aka your boss) a reason to fire you.
Olive: Right now, you're in a tough situation because you need the job more than they need you - so, even though it's unfair (and I completely agree with you btw), the only way to win the war is to not let them get you down.
Olive: Man... I suck at giving advice.
Robin: Completely useless information is always useful for pub quizzes, flattered, deffinatly go with flattered
Olive: What about the remainder of my answer... ?
Robin: the advice is good, and your right I just need to push through it, as for military I've not a clue, run with the pups try and rehabilitate my joints and see if theres any career I can do, although im also looking at museum's as a possible career

Kyle: I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust.

Vince: What's the difference?
Roseanne: I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. But I love it when all my stuff just lies around.

Roseanne: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun.
Vince: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? :D
Roseanne: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job.
Kyle: Do they pay him? :P
Roseanne: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way?
Megan: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me.
Roseanne: The famous chocolate cookies?

Bob: Very strange. Why are they only doing this now?

Vince: The most important thing is reinforcement - you verbally punish your dog (never hit him tho) and reward the times when he starts tearing the pillows but listens to you when you tell him to stop. Be careful tho, he might start playing with them just to stop later and get a treat or something - reward the times when he's near the pillow in a playful mood and doesn't touch them. And most importantly - get him some toys. He might just need something to play with.

Tony: In Britain the farce of Brexit looms over everything all day every day. It's going to affect us all in a most adverse manner. No doubt about it.
Gloria: I'll never understand why so many voted for it.
Tony: Nor will I. It is hard to believe that as a nation we have been so stupid as to vote to leave the EU. Utter and sheer short-sightedness.

Tony: That's a good plan. But how about me visiting France or Spain??? Any family or friends there?

Tony: Definitely. Those morons voted ""for"" out of ignorance, out of sheer lack of knowledge and understanding. Common awareness of economic and political consequences of Brexit has made a quantum jump in this country as late as in the last few months.
Tony: And if you ask me, the Irish border issue cannot be solved thru' any diplomatic channels. It either stays open, the way it is now, or we have a new armed conflict with no prospect of being settled.

Anna: Are we organising it just for our team or the whole department?
Derek: I don't know. I thought the department may be more fun, but then we don't know each other that well, so it may be quite troublesome to buy a right gift
Patricia: Yeah, but the point of Secret Santa is not buying precisely what the other person wants, but just having a bit of fun
Michael: I think we should stick to our team. There's the right number and I think 20 is enough
Anna: Hm, you may be right.
Derek: Ok, so now - price range. What do you reckon?
Patricia: 30?
Michael: It's quite a lot...
Patricia: Well, can you buy a decent gift for less than that? I'm not talking about buying someone a candle...

Nate: I get your point
Gabriel: I am unfortunately afraid of it as well
Gabriel: but it means that we have to wait till he really destroys this country completely, so the majority would be convinced he is evil or at least incompetent
Nate: but it may be too late then, he's not only destroying this country but the whole planet
Nate: think about the Paris Agreement
Isabella: right, very sad
Isabella: ok, there is some hope that the impeachment procedures would be conducted thoroughly presenting to the public all malpractices of this administration
Isabella: especially the Russian story may be appealing to the conservative mind
Gabriel: right, but as said - there are too many good reasons
Isabella: but for that to happen we really need to convince some republicans and media
Gabriel: and there is a question - who after Trump? According to the constitution I believe Pence should become the president
Gabriel: and he's a real bigot, arguably worse then demoralised Trump, who after all doesn't care about most of the things apart from his ego

My sister had just taken a bad fall in the bathroom hitting her L lower rib cage against an edge of a bathtub and is experiencing general pain. She doesn't think she's broken anything. Would you think it might be something demanding medical attention?
Peter: Good evening Tim, I'm still in bed reading, Emma is asleep, so I'll stick to writing. Firstly, sorry to hear that but don't worry. If she can still move and talk, it can't be too bad. She doesn't spit blood, does she?
Tim: No.
Peter: Is the impacted area swollen?
Tim: No.
Peter: BTW when did it happen?
Tim: Not more than an hour ago.
Peter: Is she alone? Sorry I mean immediate help if her condition deteriorated.
Tim: She lives alone. Her next door neighbours are just across the yard but I don't think they would be much help, being old themselves.
Peter: Do you think she'll be capable of phoning in case of an urgent need?
Tim: I should think so. Well, she texted me after the accident.
Peter: While you talked to her, was she lucid?
Tim: We couldn't talk because of my wife and the baby in the same room. She also preferred to write, since, as I suppose, it was less painful that talking. And yes – she was absolutely lucid.
Peter: Of course I cannot say anything definite without examining her but judging by the symptoms you've described I'd tend to say that it's just soreness due to the impact of the fall. But she has to observe her body.
Tim: Exactly what I told her! Should she see a doctor?
Peter: She might if she feels worse. What she may need, however, are painkillers. Tell your sister not to hesitate to take painkillers. Even strong ones. For that she may need a prescription.
Tim: Will they advise me at the drugstore when I describe the case? Anything over the counter?
Peter: If you're going to get them for her, take IBU-ratiopharm 400 g, 20 pills, and 10 pills of the same but 600 g. She may want to start with the stronger one.
Peter: Yes, they're available over the counter.
Tim: It's so generous of you to let me have all this advice at this late hour. I really appreciate it, Peter. Thank you very much.
Peter: Really nothing to thank for. Glad I could help. Let me know how she's doing.
Tim: I will. Thank you again. And good night.

Kamil: oh, and the famous beach place?
Kamil: Anca? any ideas?
Kamil: but we don't need to see all at once. We also need hints how to do it all cheaply 😂
Joona: Coney Island? The beach with the amusement park? It's cool, it's just off-season right now, so it's quite empty and eerie 👻
Joona: Ok, I'll think about cheap possibilities and ideas 🙂 Plus you'll nail Boston! (It's also an awesome city!)
Kamil: i think so!
Kamil: hmm, it's so much to see, but I would also rely on your opinions :) you've been there for a while

Anca: And the Brooklyn Bridge but I don't know, do these things need to be arranged, or one can just go? Moma for example, or the esb?
Joona: Well, maybe planned is a better word for it 😀 Like if you want to see a show on Broadway, queuing for cheap tickets is a special process. And Guggenheim, for example, is pay-what-you-wish on Saturday evenings, Whitney on Friday evenings - MoMA sadly is always the same price but I'll make some kind of list of things 🙂
Anca: So yes, we need some plans!
Anca: Oh thank you 😍 How is the weather? Decent?
Joona: At the moment it's cold and first snow came last week

Hettie: Dear Peggie, how sweet of you to remember! Thank you very much.
Peggie: I thought I'd contact you today rather than on your birthday proper so that I don't interrupt any celebrations. Time difference and so on.How are you doing?
Hettie: Certainly you wouldn't interrupt anything. The only celebration planned for tomorrow is an evening meal with my son and his wife. And with Thomas of course.
Hettie: Thank you. We are fine. Just the usual routine, nothing special happening. And how are you? Must be ages since we were in touch last!
Peggie: Nothing of importance happens in a life of an old woman! Apart from occasional ailments and similar discomforts. Thank goodness I'm fine.

As long as I feel fit to look after it, I'll stay here. So that's my news.
Peggie: Would you remember old Mr Lars, my next door neighbour? Well, he passed away two months ago. A stroke, I heard. Such a nice person! And not that old at all. 86 or something.
Hettie: Congratulations and best wishes to Laura! So how many children have they got now? I've somehow lost count.
Hettie: Yes, I remember him. So sorry to hear about his death.
Peggie: With the twins four. It's Simon whose family keeps on growing. They have got five children and Adela, Simon's wife, says she'd like to have a baby again. Well... They can surely afford it so why not? They are a very harmonious family.
Hettie: I can understand that you don't want to leave the house you've spent most of your life in. It's such a beautiful house too.
Hettie: By the way, we will probably be moving house soon too. A real estate agent, in fact a good friend of ours, has found an old farmhouse in need of a major overhaul in the area close to the Grampians. I have always wanted to live there!

Steve: sounds bad
Bo: and there was a several hour delay at the beginning 
Steve: not encouraging
Bo: Yeah, but once it started it got better. You have to give it to them they really put a lot of effort in the props, the set and the costumes for npcs
Steve: any pictures?
Bo: I have several hundred actually, but I have to sift through them, so I'm just gonna upload them in a couple of days 
Steve: ok
Bo: and other players where generally good. Made a couple of friends there actually

Bo: yeah, they're definitely interested and I'm pretty sure they have no problem traveling across the country for larps. 
Steve: great to hear
Bo: yeah, anyway there was also a group of orcs - I think they all new each other beforehand - and they were getting shit-faced every night, making lewd comments to girls and generally being assholes to everyone. 
Steve: shit, did you tell the organizers? 
Bo: yeah, I did, quite a few times, and they supposedly talked to them, but it didn't help at all 
Steve: too bad
Bo: if it was my larp I'll just kick them out and ban them from other events right after the first night of this shit
Steve: totally
Bo: And that was another thing I have a problem with - the organizers just weren't assertive enough with them. If a player ruins the game for everyone else you just kick him or her out, simple as that
Steve: You can always give them feedback about all this
Bo: I already did, cause they obviously put a lot of effort into this and just have to fix some things until next year. ",11389,Bo went to a larp. There was chaos at every step before the event. There was also a group of orcs who were getting shit-faced every night.

Mary: Oh my gosh! So you are travelling again. What is it like there? How long are you staying there?
Carol: Yes, Will insisted on a couple of months in the tropics before his hip operation, so we decided to go full bore and try again something rougher. So far everything's been going smoothly.
Mary: Isn't Mexico a bit dangerous? Have they got good medical care, just in case?
Carol: We are in Yucatan only, which is pretty touristy and they put great store on safety as tourism's their major source of income. As for their medical services I do hope we won't have to try them out. Besides we both have  our foreign travel insurances with a guarantee of immediate transport to Europe, if need be. Fingers crossed!
Mary: Good! And you are extra careful too, I hope.
Carol: But of course! We've rented a car to be independent of their erratic public transport and they seem to have a good network of fairly good roads. Mostly empty, sometimes even overgrown by vegetation on the sides.We never travel after dark of course.

Mary: Good Lord! It looks like a narrow tunnel through a dense jungle! Any big animals?

Mary: Ooops! Once a teacher, always a teacher.

Anna: Oh, I bet he'd love to have an Instagram worthy photo with a fish and chips in London, hahaha!
Tom: If I were you, I'd focus on the bars more ;) Take him to Soho, skip the fancy ones though.
Anna: That goes without a question! Have a few places in mind already. He also has a sweet tooth, so I was thinking maybe Hummingbird?
Sarah: I think I may be joining you for that one! If not, take the salted caramel for my sake.
Anna: Always! I always go for the red velvet, even if Tom thinks it's overrated.
Tom: Because it is, it's just a normal cake with red dye in it.
Sarah: So Tom is definitely not going to Hummingbird with us :D Party pooper :P
Carl: How long is your cousin staying?
Anna: Four days so that's four lunches/dinners - waiting for your recommendations!
Tom: Hm... I would also suggest street food on Brick Lane or Borough's Market - if a party pooper may have something to say :P
Sarah: But never on a weekend! Unless you fancy getting stomped or like to waiting for your food like FOREVER. When is he coming?
Anna: Thursday to Sunday, so Thursday after flight it is then. Fortunately, he's flying in the morning. Thank you so much guys!
Carl: Our pleasure, as long as you bring us come cupcakes on Monday :D
Sarah: Yeah, three red velvets for Tom :P",865,"Anne's cousin is coming this weekend. Tom recommends Angelo's, Toff's, Yori, salted caramel, Hummingbird and red velvet."
