Ron: I might be lacking the context here
Michaela: Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example
Jessie: I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork.
Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year.
Michaela: These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person.
Steve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility
Ron: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there?
Michaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really.
Jessie: so what do we get from it really?
Michaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp.
Michaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other>
Ron: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association
Jessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually
Michaela: I recall two as well
Steve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort.
Steve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours
Ron: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding
Michaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association
Jessie: well... I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work
Michaela: as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly
Ron: I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it
Michaela: Steve?
Steve: I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now
Michaela: Ok, maybe it's better to talk about this in person. Is Monday after the meeting ok for you all?
Steve: yup, I can stay a bit longer

"Max: Din anyone actually watch this the video? 
Max: <link_video>
Allen: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.
Jeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an ""occasional low cumulative"", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month.
Max: Tom You didn‚Äôt watch the video.
Tom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;)

Rawiri: Jason Hollis yuck...why even???
Tom: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint?
David: I don‚Äôt believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small...
Ken: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues.
Tom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine
Brian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates.
Ken: Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it.

Noah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.
Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.
Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?
Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.
Sophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.
Noah: OK.
Sophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?
Noah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!
Sophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.
Noah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.
Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?
Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of ""family care"" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.
Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!
Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.
Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?
Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.
Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.
Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.
Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.
Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.
Sophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?
Noah: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!
Sophie: Thank you for the quince!",15082,Sophie will collect the quince from Noah's terrace any time. The quince is in a basket on the terrace. The quince is windfall. The twins will be coming home tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield.

Alan: Yes and Catriona Balfe
Simon: Indeed. There's nobody on Breaking Bad who quite equals her, is there?
Alan: I quite liked Marie Schrader and Jessie's girlfriend who chokes on her own vomit, but Skyler is not exactly my type:

"Gabriel: Hi guys! good news:
Gabriel: <file_other>
Isabella: that's quite amazing
Nate: finally, he really should be impeached, such a disgrace for America
Isabella: I agree, although I'm not sure it wouldn't be counterproductive 
Nate: what do you mean?
Isabella: that his voters don't behave rationally, they are people believing in strange conspiracy theories, full of hatred etc.

Nate: I get your point
Gabriel: I am unfortunately afraid of it as well
Gabriel: but it means that we have to wait till he really destroys this country completely, so the majority would be convinced he is evil or at least incompetent
Nate: but it may be too late then, he's not only destroying this country but the whole planet

Isabella: but for that to happen we really need to convince some republicans and media
Gabriel: and there is a question - who after Trump? According to the constitution I believe Pence should become the president
Gabriel: and he's a real bigot, arguably worse then demoralised Trump, who after all doesn't care about most of the things apart from his ego

Victoria: I'll give it a read right now. :) xx
Kitty: Ooo - What are you writing about?? Miraculous ladybug figs or something else?? Good luck with the writing! :) And enjoy! :P

Victoria: But my co-author is killing me! So far, she has done a spectactular zero words. I'm busting my ** off over here, and I've a ton of History exams and crap to prepare for.

Victoria: Lol sorry, I just needed somewhere to winge. :P xoxo \o/
Kitty: Awww that's okay, feel free to complain about anything here any time. :) I know the temptation of giving up, especially when I want to add another story which is kinda unrelated. :) You don't suppose we could co-write sometime? Maybe after your exams? (Oh, and good luck with them!!! :D) 
Victoria: Sure. :) I need a break from this storyline, so if you fancy we could start developing a plot right now. xx",9491,Victoria is writing a Harry Potter fanfiction set in the 1970s. Kitty will add Victoria's story to it. Victoria's co-author has written 7000 words.

Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet
Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm

Carol: And what does Mark say? He'd been to Cuba before, hadn't he?

Carol: He's doing well, thank you. It's on the 23rd and he's not looking forward to it. But we are coping!

Carol: A combination of them all, I guess. But he doesn't talk much about it and I don't insist.
Tonia: Right. Mark will be getting his op in mid February. Too early to even start being apprehensive.
Carol: You two just enjoy your holidays and make the most of it!

Sophie: Is it because there is so little cancer in the lobes?
Zoe: That's how I understand it. But there is also Bill's heart condition. The oncologist will confirm with the cardiologist when Bill can come off the blood thinner and then will perform the op.
Sophie: We were told when it was under consideration for Wolf that the op itself is a micro op, without cutting through the skin and all that.
Zoe: That's right. 40 radioactive seeds 4 mm x 1,8 mm will be inserted into the prostate via some microsurgery procedure. No scars at all.
Sophie: How long does it take to get rid of the cancerogenous tissue?
Zoe: Radiation lasts 2 years diminishing in strength every 6 months by half. And he won't be even aware of their working.
Sophie: So it is quite good news, isn't it?
Zoe: Oh yes. Bill is very happy after seeing the doctor today.
Sophie: Aren't we lucky to live in these times of really successful medicine?
